Thank you for contributing to the Litter Map project.

Our goal is to create the best global website for people to share littered locations and to create a place through which everyone worldwide can effectively collaborate on cleaning up our planet without even knowing each other.

First and foremost, we want to promote a collaborative and respectful community. Therefore, we ask that all community members be kind and considerate regardless of circumstances. 

If you'd like to simply report a bug, please check to see if an [issue](https://github.com/earthstewards/littermap-aws-backend/issues) already exists, and if not create one.

If you have a question or would like to start a new topic, check the [discussion](https://github.com/earthstewards/littermap-aws-backend/discussions) board.

Code contributions are not the only way to help. Answering questions, helping others, reaching out and improving the documentation are immensely valuable to the community.
